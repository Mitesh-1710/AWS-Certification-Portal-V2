# AWS-Certification-Portal-V2
Application to keep track of all the activities that user performs related to AWS certification , for example enrolled for particular certification , giving assessments , Getting vouchers , etc..

The AWS Certification Portal allows users to access and manage their certification activities, progress, and benefits all in one place. Previously, they had to rely on multiple websites to find and manage certification offerings. Now users can have a central place where they can find and register for different role-based AWS Certification exams, track their scheduled exams, and access benefits based on the AWS Certifications they have achieved.

The AWS Certification exam is divided into four categories. 1. Foundational 2. Associate; 3. Professional; and 4. Specialty. These categories also have their own subcategories of exam titles, with each exam title assigned its own unique exam code. Users have to first register themselves before they can login and access the portal. Users can search for specific exams by name or by exam code. They have to select a suitable exam and proceed with the further exam registration process. Also note that specific exam titles are available for a specific time period only; the user can see the time period under the specified active exam date and expiration exam date fields.

Once the user has selected the exam, they will be redirected to the exam mode selection page, where they have to select where they want to take their exam, either at an offline test centre or online at their own place. Once the user selects the mode of the exam further, they have to specify their preferred language for the exam and select the date and time of the exam. After that, the user will be redirected to the payment gateway, where they have the option of applying for a voucher to get a discount for a particular exam, and then they have to make a payment.

On the portal, users can also navigate and find their previous exam records and certificates under the Exam History and Achieved Certifications tabs, respectively. They can also view and modify their data under the "My Profile tab.
